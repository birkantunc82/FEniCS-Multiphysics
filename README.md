## Implementing multiphysics models in FEniCS: Viscoelastic flows, poroelasticity, and tumor growth
This repository includes FEniCS implementations of:
1) Viscoelastic fluids \
  1.1. Flow past a cylinder \
  1.2. Extrudate flow
2) Poroelasticity \
  2.1. Terzaghi's consolidation problem \
  2.2. Pressurized spherical cavity
3) Tumor growth

The codes were tested using Dolfin version 2019.1 installed on Docker on a Windows 10 Platform.
